#Stack with Array

this project provides an implementation of a "Stack" data structure using an "Array" in Java.
A stack is linear data structure that follows the "Last In, First Out" (LIFO) principle,
where the elements are added and removed from "top" of the stack.

## Features

- **Push**: Add elements to the top of the stack
- **Pop**: Remove elements from the top of the stack
- **Peek**: View the top element without removing it. 
- **isEmpty**: check if the stack is empty.
- **ifFull**: check if the stack is full.
- **Size**: return the size of the stack
- **Delete**: Clear all elements in the stack

## Operations

### 1. Push
Adds a new element to the top of the stack.
- **Time Complexity**: O(1)

### 2. Pop
Removes and returns the element from the top of the stack.
- **Time Complexity**: O(1)

### 3. Peek
Returns the top element without removing it.
- **Time Complexity**: O(1)

### 4. IsEmpty
Checks if the stack is empty.
- **Time Complexity**: O(1)

### 5. IsFull
Checks if the stack is full.
- **Time Complexity**: O(1)

### 6. Size
Returns the number of elements currently in the stack.
- **Time Complexity**: O(1)

### 7. Delete
Clears all elements from the stack.
- **Time Complexity**: O(1)

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or copy the `Stack` class to your project.
2. Create an instance of the stack by specifying its maximum size.
3. Use the stack's methods (`push`, `pop`, `peek`, etc.) to perform operations on the stack.
